Todo:
- fix when spam ranking lookup fails (currently skipping results of "None" in spam_filter.py, line 47)
- train on more data
- test on email from different sources (our own email?)
- add presentation notes, improve powerpoint, plan for live presentation

MANUAL

Spam Filter Improvements:

- command-line arguments (train, train on this directory, spam detect on this email, rank this word, clear training data)
- create file containing all training data so it doesn't have to be collected each time
- consider word pairs or triplets (phrases)
- put more weight on any URLs that appear in the email
- URL word decomposition (eg. aterriblesitethatwillgiveyouviruses.com)
- maintain list of URLs promoted by spammers
- ignore headers or not?
- preserve case of words (consider more training data)
- include exclamation points as constituent characters
- periods and commas are constituents if they occur between two digits
- mark words that appear in the To, From, Subject, and Return-Path fields as sug
	- e.g. "foo" in the Subject line becomes "Subject*foo"
	- this will lead to more misses
	- can use degeneration to match with less specific version of word
		- "Subject*free!" -> "Subject*free" -> "free!" -> "free"
- differentiate between frequency of exclusive word appearance in a corpus
	- e.g. 7 times only in the spam corpus vs. 1000+ times only in the spam corpus
- consider all tokens over an "interesting" threshold instead of taking the top 15
- learn from user (marking messages as spam or not spam adds them to training data)
